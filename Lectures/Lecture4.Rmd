# Derived variables


## Derived variables

- If our substantive model of interest includes derived variables, like non-linear effects and/or interactions, our imputation model should respect these.
- In the next practical, we will look at a substantive model for `sbp` in NHANES which includes the interaction between `waist_circum` and `ALQ150`.
- The imputation model should be 'compatible' or congenial with the substantive model [@Meng:1994].
- e.g. suppose our model of interest is a linear regression of $Y$ on $X$ and $X^2$, if we impute missing values of $X$ using a linear regression of $X$ on $Y$, the imputed data will not have the correct quadratic relationship between $Y$ and $X$.

## Interactions

- Suppose the outcome/substantive model contains an interaction between two predictors, $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$, one of which ($X_{1}$) is categorical (e.g. `ALQ150`).
- If $X_{1}$ is fully observed, a convenient approach to allow for the interaction is to impute separately in different levels of $X_{1}$.
- Stata's `mi` commands make this very easy: simply add `by(x1)` at the end of the command.
- In R, we could split the data into multiple data frames, run `mice` on each, and then recombining the imputed datasets.
- If $X_{1}$ itself has missing values (as in `ALQ150` variable), we cannot use this approach.
- It also does not work if both $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ are continuous, or we want to allow for multiple interactions.

## Impute then transform

- The simplest approach to handling derived variables is to perform imputation as normal, then create the derived variables (e.g. interactions) in the imputed datasets.
- This is not a good idea.
- The imputation models will not be compatible with what the substantive model.
- Biased estimates will be obtained.

## Passive imputation

- Passive imputation involves adding the derived variable(s) to the data frame and updating its value during  the imputation process.
- e.g. we can add a variable `waist_circum*AQL150` and tell `mice` how to update its value.
- This interaction term can be used as a covariate in the imputation models.

## Limitations of passive imputation

- Passive imputation has limitations - it is not always obvious how to specify imputation models which are compatible with the substantive model.
- e.g. when imputing `ALQ150`, we need to ensure its imputation model is compatible with the presence of an interaction between it and `waist_circum` in the model for `sbp`.
- Used naively it will usually lead to biased estimates.

## `Just another variable' approach

- The 'transform then impute' or 'just another variable' (JAV) approach recently proposed by von Hippel [@Hippel2009] involves treating derived variables as if they were just any other variables and includes them in the imputation process.
- e.g. we include `waist_circum*AQL150` in the imputation process and impute it as if it were a regular continuous variable, and ignore the deterministic relationship between it and `waist_circum` and `ALQ150`.
- An unappealing feature of this is that we have imputed values of `waist_circum*AQL150` which are not equal to the product of the values of `waist_circum` and `ALQ150`.


## Statistical properties of the 'just another variable' approach

- For linear models where data are MCAR, the JAV approach gives consistent point estimates, but Rubin's rules may not be valid.
- With data MAR, JAV gives biased estimates, since it consists of fitting a mis-specified parametric model by maximum likelihood.
- For logistic regression models JAV can be badly biased.
- For more on this, see [@Seaman2012].

## Substantive model compatible FCS (SMC-FCS)

- We developed a modified version of MICE/FCS, which imputes each covariate compatibly with a user-specified substantive model (SM) [@Bartlett2014].
- Suppose we have an outcome of interest $Y$, partially observed covariates $X_{1},X_{2},..,X_{p}$, and fully observed covariates $\mathbf Z$.
- We specify a substantive model (SM) for $f(Y|X_{1},..,X_{p},\mathbf Z,\psi)$, with parameters $\psi$.
- e.g. linear regression of $Y$, with covariate vector some function of $X_{1},..,X_{p}$ and $\mathbf Z$.
- e.g. covariates include $X_{1} \times X_{2}$, or $X_{1}^2$, or $X_{1}/X_{2}^2$...
- The covariates $X_{1},..,X_{p}$ have missing values.

## Substantive model compatible FCS

- We must impute from a model for $f(X_{j}|X_{-j},\mathbf Z,Y)$.
- This can be expressed as
\begin{align*}
	\frac{f(Y|X_{j},X_{-j},\mathbf Z)f(X_{j}|X_{-j},\mathbf Z)}{\int f(Y|X^{*}_{j},X_{-j},\mathbf Z) f(X^{*}_{j}|X_{-j},\mathbf Z) dX^{*}_{j}}.
	\end{align*}
- The SM is a model for $f(Y|X_{j},X_{-j},\mathbf Z)$.
- We can thus specify an IM for $X_{j}$ which is compatible with the SM by additionally specifying a model for $f(X_{j}|X_{-j},\mathbf Z)$.

## Drawing imputations

- Having specified a model for $f(X_{j}|X_{-j},\mathbf Z)$, the implied imputation model $f(X_{j}|X_{-j},\mathbf Z,Y)$ will in general not belong to a standard distributional family.
- We appeal to the Monte-Carlo method of rejection sampling to generate draws.
- Rejection sampling involves drawing from an easy-to-sample (candidate) distribution until a particular criterion/bound is satisfied.
- Deriving this bound is relatively easy if we use our model for $f(X_{j}|X_{-j},\mathbf Z)$ as the candidate distribution.

## `smcfcs`

- [`smcfcs`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=smcfcs) implements the SMC-FCS approach in R.
- Linear, logistic and Cox proportional hazards outcome models are supported.
- It also supports competing risks outcomes, and nested case-control and case-cohort studies.
- Normal linear, logistic, Poisson, proportional odds and multinomial logistic imputation methods are provided.
- The SM can contain essentially any function of the variables, e.g. squares, cubes, interactions, logarithms of variables, etc etc.
- The approach can also be used when imputing components of a ratio variable, e.g. BMI.
- In the practical we will see how `smcfcs` can be used to accommodate an interaction, and be used to impute missing covariates in a Cox model analysis.


# Survival outcomes


## Incorporating the outcome in imputation

- As we noted earlier, the outcome variable in the final model of interest \emph{must} be included in the imputation model.
- If we do not, imputed values will not have the correct associations with the outcome.
- How to incorporate the outcome in an imputation model depends on the type of variable being imputed and the type of outcome / outcome model.




## Survival outcomes

- A common outcome type is time to some event of interest (often called survival outcomes).
- Sometimes we do not observe the event occurring for every subject in the available follow-up, leading to censoring.
- The outcome then consists of a variable $T$ representing time to the event of interest and an event indicator $D$ ($D=1$ if event occured, $D=0$ otherwise).
- If $D=0$, $T$ records the censoring time -- the last time at which a subject was seen, and had still not had the event.
- If we have some missing values in the covariates $X$ in our survival model, how should we impute them?




## Incorporating survival outcomes in imputation models

- Early recommendations were to impute $X$ by putting $T$ (or $\log(T)$ and $D$ as covariates).
- More recently, @White2009 investigated theoretically how the imputation model for $X$ should be specified when a Cox proportinal hazards model is used:	
\begin{align}
	h(t|\mathbf X) = h_{0}(t) \exp(\boldsymbol \beta^{T} \mathbf X)
\end{align}
	where $h_{0}(t)$ denotes an arbitrary baseline hazard function and $\boldsymbol \beta$ a vector of (log) hazard ratios.




## Incorporating survival outcomes in imputation models

- White and Royston showed that when imputing a normally distributed variable $X$ one should use a linear regression imputation model, with $D$ and $H_{0}(T) = \int^{T}_{0} h_{0}(u) du$ (baseline cumulative hazard function) as covariates.
- For binary $X$, one should use a logistic regression imputation model, again with $D$ and $H_{0}(T)$ as covariates.
- Their results are exact for binary $X$, but are approximate for normal $X$.
- The approximation for normal $X$ should work well provided the covariate $X$ does not have a large effect on hazard or if the incidence of the event of interest is low.




## Incorporating survival outcomes in imputation models

- $H_{0}(t)=\int^{t}_{0} h_{0}(u) du$ is the baseline cumulative hazard function.
- White and Royston suggest a number of approaches to estimating $H_{0}(t)$:
	
  - Substantive knowledge - e.g. it may be reasonable to assume constant baseline hazard so that $H_{0}(t) \propto t$. In this case, we just include $D$ and $T$ as covariates in our imputation model(s).
	- When covariate effects are small, one could approximate $H_{0}(t)$ by the Nelson-Aalen (marginal) cumulative hazard estimator $H(t)$, which ignores covariates and thus can be estimated using all subjects.
	- Estimating $H_{0}(t)$ within the FCS algorithm by fitting the Cox proportional hazards model to the current imputed dataset.
	




## Substantive model compatible FCS

- Our SMC-FCS approach can also `solve' the problem.
- Each partially observed covariate is imputed compatibly with the specified Cox model.
- Our approach is particularly attractive if there are additionally interactions or non-linear covariate effects in the Cox model.
- If censoring mechanism is related to partially observed covariate(s), then censoring should be treated as a competing risk at the imputation stage.


# Imputation with dependent data

## Example - longitudinal data

- Suppose some quantity $y$ was intended to be measured repeatedly on subjects over time.
- There are some missing values of $y$.
- How should we impute these missing values?

## Imputing in 'long form'

id | gender | time | y 
---|--------|------|-----
1  | m      | 0    | 4.5
1  | m      | 1    | 3.9
1  | m      | 2    | 4.1
1  | m      | 3    | . 
1  | m      | 4    | 4.2

- If we impute the dataset is 'long' form, we treat each observation as independent.
- This is clearly inappropriate - observations from the same subject are usually correlated.
- The observed values of $y$ on a subject contain information about missing $y$ at $t=3$.
- If we ignore the longitudinal structure, imputations will not only be inefficient, they will not have the correct correlation structure.

## Imputing in 'wide form'

id | gender | y0 | y1 | y2 | y3 | y4
---|--------|----|----|----|----|----
1  | m      | 4.5| 3.9| 4.1| .  | 4.2

- If measurement times are common to all subjects, we may be able to impute with the data in 'wide' form.
- e.g. we could apply `mice` to gender, y0, y1, y2, y3, y4.
- This uses available longitudinal information to impute missing value at $t=3$ for $\mbox{id}=1$.
- Note that this strategy generally cannot be applied if observations take place at different times for different subjects.
- You may run into co-linearity issues when $y$ is highly correlated within subjects over time.

## Example - clustered data

- Another form of dependent data is clustered of multi-level data.
- The clustering should be accounted for in the imputation process.

## Including fixed cluster effects

- One approach is to include cluster id as a fixed effect covariate in imputation models.
- Standard MI software can be used.
- If each cluster has a large number of (observed) units, this could work well.
- But if the substantive model is a random effects model, it has been shown to lead to invalid inferences [@Andridge2011].

## Imputation by cluster

- Yet another approach is to impute separately in each cluster, thus allowing parameters to vary by cluster.
- This should work well when there are a small number of large clusters.
- An advantage of this approach is that it allows all the imputation model parameters to differ between clusters.
- Conversely, a disadvantage is that information is not borrowed between clusters.
- If there are many clusters, and/or clusters are small, imputation by cluster may perform poorly.

## Random-effects imputation

- If your substantive analyses would treat the dependency in the data through random effects, you should probably impute mising data using random effects models.
- The principles of MI remain the same - all that changes is that we have random effects in our imputation model(s).

## Random-effects imputation software

- [`mice`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mice) can impute variables using FCS with certain random effects models.
- [`jomo`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=jomo) can impute using joint random effects models based on latent multivariate normal structure.
- [`jointAI`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=JointAI) can impute using joint random effects models based on factorising the joint distribution as a product of conditionals.
- For further details, see @vanBuuren2011 and @audigier2018multiple.

## Likelihood based approaches

- If missingness is confined to the outcome variable, likelihood based approaches are statistically efficient and valid under MAR.
- In such cases, there is little point in trying to attempt imputation.
- This is the case for both dependent data situations and simpler independent data situations.

# Survey data

## MI with survey data

- Rubin's original aim was for MI to be used in the context of large survey datasets.
- However, it is not clear how `proper' imputations can be generated when data were collected using a complex survey design.
- @Seaman2012a derived some important results concerning this.

## Recommendations for MI with survey data
Seaman et al's results imply that when performing MI with weighted survey data we should:

1. include the sample design weights as a covariate (not as a weight!) in the imputation model(s),
2. when analysing the imputed datasets, the completed data analyses should be weighted using the survey design weights.

## Variance estimation

- One issue is that Rubin's variance estimator can be biased upwards (conservative inference) if the imputer makes an assumption which the analyst doesn't.
- In simple settings, Seaman et al showed that the upward bias in variance estimates could be avoided by including interactions between weights and fully observed variables.
- Even when Rubin's variance estimator was biased (upwards), Seaman et al found that the bias was small.
- In practice therefore, we might worry less about this issue.


# Summary


## Summary

- Care must be taken that variables are imputed compatibly/congenially with subsequent analyses (substantive models).
- In particular, imputing derievd variables involved in interactions or non-linear effects requires care.
- e.g. with a Cox model, we must account for the outcome appropriately if imputing covariates.
- e.g. with dependent data, our imputation model should ideally account for the dependency.
