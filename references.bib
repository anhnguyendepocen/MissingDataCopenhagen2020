	In the case that the explanatory vectors are independent and identically
	distributed with unknown distribution, efficient score functions
	are identified. Related results for the structural case are given

  abstract = {The problem of regression dilution arising from covariate measurement
	error is investigated for survival data using the proportional hazards
	model. The naive approach to parameter estimation is considered whereby
	observed covariate values are used, inappropriately, in the usual
	analysis instead of the underlying covariate values. A relationship
	between the estimated parameter in large samples and the true parameter
	is obtained showing that the bias does not depend on the form of
	the baseline hazard function when the errors are normally distributed.
	With high censorship, adjustment of the naive estimate by the factor
	1 + $\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the ratio of within-person variability
	about an underlying mean level to the variability of these levels
	in the population sampled, removes the bias. As censorship increases,
	the adjustment required increases and when there is no censorship
	is markedly higher than 1 + $\lambda$ and depends also on the true
	risk relationship.},

	of variation, involving only resampling variability. Our conditional
	analysis is founded on a belief that Monte Carlo error should not
	be allowed to determine the conclusions of a statistical analysis
	and indicates that approximately 800 resamples are required for this
	purpose. The argument can be generalized to the multivariate setting
	and a simple formula is given for determining a lower bound on the
	number of resamples required to approximate an m-dimensional bootstrap
	variance-covariance matrix.}
